To make the bot work you need to do some steps:

- Open the game on your main desktop

- Train a full army of Electro Dragons with as many rage spell you can

- Go to the setting and activate the double deploy bar

- Install all dependencies

- Install [Google Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)

- Change the path to the tesseract file

- Change the constants on the _main.py_ file to chose the loot you want

- let the bot do his work :)
